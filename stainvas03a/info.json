    "abstract": "<p>\nIt is well known that even slight changes in nonuniform illumination\nlead to a large image variability  and are crucial  for\nmany visual tasks. This paper presents a new ICA related\nprobabilistic model where the number of sources exceeds the number of\nsensors to  perform an image segmentation and  illumination removal, simultaneously.\nWe model illumination and reflectance in log space\nby a generalized autoregressive process and Hidden Gaussian Markov random field, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe model ability to deal with segmentation of illuminated images\nis compared with a Canny edge detector and homomorphic filtering.\nWe apply the model to two problems: synthetic image segmentation and\nsea surface pollution detection from intensity images.\n</p>",
