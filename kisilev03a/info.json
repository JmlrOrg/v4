    "abstract": "We consider the problem of blind separation of unknown source signals or images from a given set of their linear mixtures. \nIt was discovered recently that exploiting the sparsity of sources and their mixtures, once they are projected onto a proper \nspace of sparse representation, improves the quality of separation. In this study we take advantage of the properties of \nmultiscale transforms, such as wavelet packets, to decompose signals into sets of local features with various degrees of \nsparsity. We then study how the separation error is affected by the sparsity of decomposition coefficients, and by the \nmisfit between the probabilistic model of these coefficients and their actual distribution. Our error estimator, based on \nthe Taylor expansion of the quasi-ML function, is used in selection of the best subsets of coefficients and utilized, in \nturn, in further separation. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by using noise-free and noisy data. Experiments \nwith simulated signals, musical sounds and images, demonstrate significant improvement of separation quality over previously \nreported results.",
