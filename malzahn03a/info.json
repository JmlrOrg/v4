    "abstract": "Using a novel reformulation, we develop a\nframework to compute approximate resampling data averages\nanalytically. The method avoids multiple retraining of statistical models\non the samples. Our approach uses a combination of\nthe replica \"trick\" of statistical physics and the TAP approach for\napproximate\nBayesian inference. We demonstrate our approach on regression with Gaussian\nprocesses. A comparison with averages obtained by Monte-Carlo\nsampling shows that our method achieves good accuracy.",
